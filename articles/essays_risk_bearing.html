        <h1>Essays on Risk Bearing</h1>
        <p><em>Essays on Risk Bearing, written by Frank H. Knight, introduces the concepts of uncertainty and risk in economic theory. Knight distinguishes between insurable risks and uninsurable uncertainties, providing the foundation for modern discussions on risk and entrepreneurship.</em></p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In *Essays on Risk Bearing*, Knight examines the role of risk in economic decision-making, particularly focusing on how entrepreneurs deal with uncertainty. He argues that while risks can be insured against, true uncertainty cannot be predicted or calculated, and it is this uncertainty that creates opportunities for entrepreneurial action. Knight’s work laid the foundation for modern risk theory and decision-making under uncertainty.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Risk vs. Uncertainty:</strong> Knight makes a key distinction between risk, which can be quantified and insured against, and uncertainty, which is unknowable and cannot be managed through conventional probability methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Entrepreneurship and Risk Bearing:</strong> Entrepreneurs are seen as the individuals who take on uncertainty, making decisions that involve uninsurable risks, and thereby driving innovation and economic progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Profit as a Reward for Risk:</strong> Knight suggests that profit is the reward for bearing uncertainty, distinguishing it from wages and interest, which compensate for insurable risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Uncertainty in Decision Making:</strong> The inability to predict future events, particularly in new markets or with new technologies, creates an environment where entrepreneurs must make decisions based on incomplete knowledge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact on Economic Theory</h3>
        <p>Knight’s work has had a lasting influence on the field of economics, particularly in the development of theories on entrepreneurship and the role of uncertainty in market economies. His ideas helped shape the Austrian school of economics and have been foundational in discussions about business cycles, market structure, and the behavior of firms in conditions of uncertainty.</p>
