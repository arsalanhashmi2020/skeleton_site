        <h1>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</h1>
        <p><em>Published in 2013 by Thomas Piketty, *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* explores the dynamics of wealth and income inequality, examining the history of capital accumulation and its impact on economic inequality in modern economies.</em></p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*, Piketty provides an analysis of the evolution of wealth and income inequality over the past few centuries. He argues that when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, inequality increases. Piketty explores the relationship between capital and inequality, illustrating how wealth accumulation has become increasingly concentrated among the wealthy, and how this threatens social and economic stability.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Themes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Dynamics of Capital:</strong> Piketty examines how wealth is accumulated and distributed across generations, focusing on the relationship between capital and income inequality.</li>
            <li><strong>Wealth Inequality:</strong> The book discusses how wealth inequality has grown over the past few centuries, with a focus on the historical trends that have shaped modern economies.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital and Growth:</strong> Piketty argues that when the rate of return on capital is higher than the rate of economic growth, wealth becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of the wealthy, exacerbating inequality.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Solutions:</strong> Piketty proposes progressive taxation on wealth and income to address inequality and prevent further concentration of capital.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact on Economics</h3>
        <p>*Capital in the Twenty-First Century* has sparked widespread debate and has had a significant impact on discussions of inequality, wealth distribution, and economic policy. Piketty’s argument that capital accumulation can lead to rising inequality has influenced policymakers and economists, especially in the context of globalization and modern economic systems.</p>
