        <h1>The Wealth of Nations</h1>
        <p><em>Published in 1776 by Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations is often regarded as the founding work of modern economics. The book addresses the nature and causes of a nation's prosperity and explores fundamental ideas such as the division of labor, productivity, and free markets.</em></p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The Wealth of Nations is a treatise on economic principles and policies that influence the wealth and prosperity of nations. Smith discusses the benefits of specialization and how the division of labor increases productivity. He introduces the idea of the "invisible hand," explaining how individuals pursuing their own self-interest can lead to positive outcomes for society as a whole.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Themes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Division of Labor:</strong> Smith argues that dividing production into specialized tasks leads to greater efficiency and a higher standard of living.</li>
            <li><strong>Free Markets and Competition:</strong> The book advocates for limited government intervention, with the market regulating itself through competition and the pursuit of profit.</li>
            <li><strong>Value and Exchange:</strong> Smith explores how the value of goods and services is determined through market forces such as supply and demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Role of Government:</strong> While advocating for minimal intervention, Smith recognizes the role of government in protecting property rights, enforcing contracts, and maintaining public infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact on Economics</h3>
        <p>The Wealth of Nations laid the groundwork for classical economics and has had a profound influence on the development of economic thought. Smith's ideas on capitalism and the benefits of free trade have shaped economic policies and continue to be relevant in contemporary discussions about economic growth and development.</p>
        
        <h3>Notable Quotations</h3>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>"The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgement with which it is anywhere directed or applied, seem to have been the effects of division of labour." â€“ Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations</p>
