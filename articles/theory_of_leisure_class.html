        <h1>Theory of the Leisure Class</h1>
        <p><em>Published in 1899 by Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class critiques the social structure and consumption habits of the wealthy, emphasizing the role of conspicuous consumption and the distinction between productive and unproductive activities in modern society.</em></p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Veblen argues that the leisure class is defined not by its productive work, but by its ability to engage in conspicuous consumption, the display of wealth and status through consumption of luxury goods and services. He critiques the capitalist system, which he believes fosters wasteful consumption rather than productive work. This book provides a foundation for modern sociology and economics by examining the social and cultural impacts of wealth inequality.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conspicuous Consumption:</strong> The idea that the wealthy class spends money not for practical use, but to signal their social status and wealth.</li>
            <li><strong>Leisure Class:</strong> A social class that does not engage in productive labor, instead engaging in activities that are deemed prestigious and dignified, such as leisure and display of wealth.</li>
            <li><strong>Vicarious Leisure:</strong> The phenomenon where the wealthy class uses the labor of others to maintain their leisure lifestyle, thereby reinforcing social class divisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Wasteful Consumption:</strong> The tendency for the wealthy to engage in consumption that does not contribute to their well-being but serves to display power and prestige.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact on Social Theory</h3>
        <p>The Theory of the Leisure Class has had a profound impact on sociology and economics. Veblen’s ideas challenged conventional views of wealth and class by focusing on the cultural and social implications of consumption. His critique of the capitalist system laid the groundwork for future discussions about class inequality and the ethical consequences of excessive wealth accumulation.</p>
