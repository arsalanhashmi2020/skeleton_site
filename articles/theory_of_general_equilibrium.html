        <h1>Theory of General Equilibrium</h1>
        <p><em>The *Theory of General Equilibrium* is a concept in economic theory that examines the interactions of supply and demand across all markets simultaneously, leading to an equilibrium where the allocation of resources is optimal and no individual can improve their position without making someone else worse off.</em></p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The *Theory of General Equilibrium* examines the conditions under which markets can achieve an efficient allocation of resources through price adjustments. It builds on the idea that each market is interdependent, with the price in one market influencing others. The theory shows how the simultaneous determination of prices and quantities across all markets can lead to a stable and efficient equilibrium, where all agents are optimizing their decisions. The general equilibrium framework includes models of competitive markets, consumer preferences, and production possibilities.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Themes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Interdependence:</strong> The theory highlights how changes in one market (e.g., labor or goods) can affect the outcomes in other markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency of Equilibrium:</strong> General equilibrium demonstrates that under certain conditions, market outcomes can lead to an efficient allocation of resources, where no further gains are possible without losses elsewhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Role of Prices in Coordination:</strong> Prices act as signals and coordination devices that balance supply and demand across multiple markets simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations and Critiques:</strong> While the theory is elegant in its assumptions, it has faced criticism for its reliance on ideal conditions such as perfect competition and complete information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact on Economic Thought</h3>
        <p>The *Theory of General Equilibrium* has shaped much of modern economic theory, especially in the field of microeconomics. It provides a rigorous framework for understanding how markets can function efficiently under idealized conditions and offers insights into welfare economics, policy-making, and market design. However, its assumptions have been contested, and more recent work in economic theory has sought to incorporate more realistic elements such as market imperfections and behavioral biases.</p>
