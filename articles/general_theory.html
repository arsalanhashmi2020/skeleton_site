        <h1>The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</h1>
        <p><em>Published in 1936 by John Maynard Keynes, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money revolutionized economic thought by challenging classical economics and introducing ideas about aggregate demand, government intervention, and the role of uncertainty in economic behavior.</em></p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The General Theory critiques the classical economic theories that were dominant in the early 20th century, particularly the belief that economies are self-correcting. Keynes argues that demand is the driving force behind economic activity, and that insufficient demand can lead to prolonged periods of unemployment and underproduction. He advocates for government intervention in the economy, particularly through fiscal policy, to manage demand and stabilize economic fluctuations.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Themes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aggregate Demand:</strong> Keynes introduces the concept of aggregate demand as the total demand for goods and services in an economy, which is the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending.</li>
            <li><strong>Unemployment and Involuntary Unemployment:</strong> Keynes challenges the classical view that the labor market will always reach full employment. He asserts that involuntary unemployment is a real phenomenon that can persist in a market economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Role of Government:</strong> Keynes advocates for active government intervention in the economy, particularly through public spending and investment, to stimulate demand and reduce unemployment.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest Rates and Investment:</strong> Keynes explores the relationship between interest rates, investment, and savings, suggesting that investment can be influenced by expectations about the future rather than solely by the interest rate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact on Economics</h3>
        <p>The General Theory had a profound influence on economic thought and policy. It became the foundation for Keynesian economics, which emphasized the importance of government intervention to stabilize the economy. Keynesian economics became the dominant school of thought in the mid-20th century and influenced the development of macroeconomic theory and policy, particularly during the post-World War II era.</p>
